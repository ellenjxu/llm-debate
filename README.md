# llm-debate

Runs multi-agent debate with open-source HuggingFace models on the Arithmetic problem.

`gen_math.py` has code for running debates with HuggingFace model (e.g. mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)

To reproduce the figure in original paper (scaling with rounds and agents), run `./gen_math.sh` training script
